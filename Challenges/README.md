## Overview

You've already built a basic homepage in [index.html](Sample%20Website/index.html), styled with [css/style.css](Sample%20Website/css/style.css) and made interactive with [js/script.js](Sample%20Website/js/script.js). Now it's time to level up! Your mission is to add more pages with fresh content and new features. Let your creativity shine as you experiment and learn.

## Challenge 4: GitHub Copilot in Action

**Task:**  
Use GitHub Copilot to improve your code.

**Instructions:**
